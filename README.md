//ISSUES: The biggest I faced was not have my javascript tag and the bottom of the page. None of my code ran and I didn't know what was happening.
//I had issues with figuring out the for loops for the start over button and the hovering. It was difficult figuring out the structure of the functions that needed to go inside the loops.

//RESOURCES: I used the class recording and the linkedIn recordings from the module.
